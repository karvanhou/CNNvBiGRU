# CNNvBiGRU
Static Android malware detection framework 
Developed an innovative static Android malware detection framework for my MSc project. This framework utilized natural language processing (Word2Vec) alongside a hybrid architecture combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The objective was to extract features and sequence modelling from Android opcode sequences. The model, trained using TensorFlow, enabled the automation of Android malware detection.
